Implements a Set class backed by a singly linked list (Node), storing unique ints.
 # Features:
 - Construction from std::initializer_list<int>
 - insert, erase, find, clear, merge
- Set operations: union (|), intersection (&), difference (-), symmetric diff (^)
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- No main() neededâ€”testing harness provided separately
